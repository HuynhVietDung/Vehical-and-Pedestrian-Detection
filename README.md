# Take-home-challenge: Build autonomous vehicle AI system

## Overview
This project aim to build autonomous vehicle AI system tailored for rural environments, focusing on three critical tasks: known object detection, novel object detection, and collision avoidance.

## Running code

Run Known Object Detection _ YOLOv8n.ipynb for fine tuning model
Run system.ipynb for system running
